#Point_of_Sale_System


I am continuously working on this project and plan to add new features and make improvements in the near future.
The POS system is a web application that allows a retailer to process sales transactions and manage their inventory. 
It is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, with a focus on streamlining the checkout process for customers and 
providing useful tools for managing inventory and analyzing sales data.
The POS system is built using object-oriented programming principles, with a set of classes that represent different aspects of the system, such as products, transactions, and customers. 
These classes are designed to be flexible and reusable, so that they can be easily modified and extended to meet the needs of different retailers.
